# Binarized-Neural-Networks-on-cifar10-and-Mnist-Dataset
BNN is a type of neural network that activations(or called features) and weights are 1-bit values in all the hidden layers (except the input and output layers). In a few words, BNN is an extremely compacted case of CNN. Because BNN and CNN have the same structures except for the different precision activations and weights. In this project, I demonstrate the usage of Binary neural networks to solve common computer vision task(classfication) using the Tensorflow framework.
